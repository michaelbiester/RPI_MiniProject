# RPI_MiniProject
a mini project using Raspberry PI as a monitoring utility

## dir: rpi_task1
a Python program `getImgJpgMulti.py` runs on the Raspberry PI. See `readme_getImgJpgMulti.md`
for how to use this program.

Another Python program `monitor_rpi_ws_server.py`watches for captured images and if there are any, a PC connected via 
websockets is notified.

Additionally there are a couple of sensors which notifiy a PC of new data. Currently these sensors are only emulated.
Future modifications of the program are expected to use *real* sensors. See `readme_monitor_rpi_ws_server.md` for more
details.
